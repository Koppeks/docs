## What are Meshery Relationships?
Relationships define the nature of interaction between interconnected components in Meshery. They represent various types of connections and dependencies between components no matter the genealogy of the relationship such as parent, siblings, binding.

## Types of Relationships

Relationships are categorized into different kinds, types, and subtypes, so that can be expressive of the specific manner in which one or more components relate to one another.

Here is a list of the different types of relationships that Meshery supports:

1. Edge-Network
      The Edge-Network rlationship type configures the networking between one or more components. An example is the         relationship between a Ingress and a Deployment
