Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.
Starting from a Helm chart is another way to get started with an entire application stack.

Meshery MeshMap provides the capability to import a design/pattern from a Helm Chart.


## Requirements

 - Access to the _Meshery Playground_. If you don't have an account, sign up at [Meshery Playground](https://play.meshery.io/).
 - Access to _MeshMap_. You can sign up for the beta at [https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshmap](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshmap).
 - A Helm chart package in **.tgz** format.


## Importing a Design

Click the **Import Design** option under the _Designs_ tab in MeshMap.

Next, provide a name under Design File Name (1), set the _Design Type_ to Helm Chart and paste the URL (3) to the location of the Helm chart package in .tgz format. 

This example uses the Meshery Server helm chart at [https://meshery.github.io/meshery.io/charts/meshery-v0.7.48.tgz](https://meshery.github.io/meshery.io/charts/meshery-v0.7.48.tgz)

You should now have MeshMap design of the chart.
