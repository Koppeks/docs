This guide will walk you through setting up your Layer5 account and getting started with Layer5 Cloud's features for collaboration and infrastructure management.

## Configuring your Layer5 account

The first steps in starting with Layer5 are to create an account, verify your email, setup an organization and a workspace, and view your profile.

There are several types of accounts on Layer5. Every person who uses Layer5 Cloud has their own personal account, which can be part of multiple organizations and teams. Your personal account is your identity on Layer5 Cloud and represents you as an individual.

1. Creating an account

To sign up for an account on cloud.layer5.io, navigate to <https://cloud.layer5.io/> and follow the prompts.
You may choose to either signup with your personal email or any of our supported OAuth providers like Github and Gmail. See "OAuth Providers" for more information.

To keep your Layer5 account secure you should use a strong and unique password. For more information, see "Creating a strong password."

2. Verifying your email address

To ensure you can use all the features in your Layer5 plan, verify your email address after signing up for a new account. For more information, see "Verifying your email address."

<!-- considering we would want to use 2FA in future
4. Configuring two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. We strongly urge you to configure 2FA for the safety of your account. For more information, see "About two-factor authentication."

Optionally, after you have configured 2FA, add a passkey to your account to enable a secure, passwordless login. For more information, see "About passkeys" and "Managing your passkeys." -->

3. Creating an organization

Organization are unit of tenant in Layer5 Cloud. Every user on Layer5 Cloud is part of at least one organization. You can create your own organization or join an existing one. By default you are the owner of the organization you create. For more information, see "About organizations."


4. Creating a workspace

Workspaces are logical group of shared set of resources like environments, connections, credentials, infrastructural designs and more. Every user on Layer5 Cloud is part of at least one workspace. You can create your own workspace or join an existing one. By default you are the owner of the workspace you create. You can share access to resouces in your workspaces through teams. For more information, see "About workspaces."

5. Viewing your Layer5 profile

Your Layer5 profile tells people the story of your work through the recent activites, and infrastructure designs that you've published to Cloud catalog, the organization memberships you've chosen to publicize. For more information, see "About your profile".
