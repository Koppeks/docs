## Configuring Components

Once you’ve added components to your design in Kanvas, configuring them is a critical step in customizing and optimizing your cloud-native infrastructure. Configuring components allows you to fine-tune their behavior, set specific parameters, and ensure they meet the precise needs of your architecture.

**Steps to Configure Components:**

1. **Select the Component:** Click on the component on the MeshMap canvas that you want to configure. This action opens the Configuration Panel.

2. **Adjust Component Settings:** In the Configuration Panel, you can modify various settings, such as resource limits, environment variables, replicas, and more, depending on the type of component you’re working with (e.g., microservices, databases).

3. **Real-time Updates:** As you adjust configurations, MeshMap will reflect those changes in real-time, allowing you to visualize how the changes affect your overall design. This feature ensures that the design is always up-to-date with the latest configurations.

By configuring components effectively, you ensure that your cloud-native deployments run smoothly and efficiently, tailored to your specific use case.

## Using the Radial Context Menu to Lock, Style, Duplicate, and Delete Components

MeshMap’s **radial context menu** provides an intuitive way to interact with components on your design canvas. This menu allows you to quickly perform key actions such as locking, styling, duplicating, and deleting components without leaving the design canvas.

### Key Functions of the Radial Context Menu:

1. **Locking Components:** Locking a component ensures it stays fixed in its position on the canvas. This feature is useful when you want to prevent accidental movement of important components during collaboration or further editing. To lock a component, right-click on it to open the radial menu and select the “Lock” option.

**Use Case:** Locking is helpful when finalizing the design layout, ensuring key components remain in place even when other collaborators make adjustments.

2. **Styling Components:** The styling option allows you to modify the appearance of the component, such as changing its color or label. This feature is especially useful for visually organizing components, making it easier to distinguish between different types or states within the architecture.

**Use Case:** Style components to represent various application states, environments (production vs. development), or priority levels in your infrastructure design.

3. **Duplicating Components:** The radial menu also provides a quick way to duplicate a component. This feature is beneficial when you need multiple instances of the same component with identical configurations.

**Use Case:** Quickly create replicas of services or microservices with consistent settings without having to reconfigure each one manually.

4. **Deleting Components:** Removing components is as simple as selecting the “Delete” option from the radial menu. This action helps keep the design clean and organized by removing unnecessary or outdated components.

**Use Case:** Delete components when modifying or refactoring your design to remove legacy infrastructure or redundant elements.

The radial context menu offers an efficient, user-friendly way to manage components within MeshMap, streamlining the design process.

## Copy and Paste Components

You can copy and paste one or more components — even if you're going from one design to another.

### Use the right-click menu or keyboard shortcuts

You might be able to copy and paste with the right-click menu, but for security reasons, most browsers don't allow web apps (like Kanvas) to use your computer's clipboard through menus.


To copy and paste, you can use keyboard shortcuts:

To copy and paste:

1. Use [keyboard shortcuts](/kanvas/reference/keyboard-shortcuts/)
1. Use the right-click menu
