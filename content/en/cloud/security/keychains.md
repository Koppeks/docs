A **keychain** is a collection of **keys** grouped together. Keychains simplify the management of permissions by allowing you to assign a set of keys to a user role. This way, you can define what actions a user can perform based on their role within the system.

### Keychains Management

#### Creating a Keychain

- To create a keychain, navigate to the **Keychains** page and click the **Create Keychain** button.
- Assign relevant keys to the keychain.
- Further, assign the keychain to the relevant user roles to grant specific permissions to users.
