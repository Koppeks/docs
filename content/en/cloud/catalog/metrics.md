Metrics provide valuable insights into how users engage with the designs, allowing us to understand usage patterns, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve the user experience.

The design catalog can be accessed from the _Layer5 Cloud_ catalog page at [Layer5 Cloud Catalog](https://meshery.layer5.io/catalog).


You can view the metrics of a Design in two ways:
1. Below each Design's catalog card, you can see its metrics.

2. By clicking on the catalog card, a modal will pop up displaying all the information about the Design, including its metrics.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each metric we track:

##### 1. Opens
**Definition:** The number of times a design is opened.<br>
**Purpose:** This metric helps us understand how often users are viewing a particular design. Frequent opens may indicate high interest or usefulness of the design.

##### 2. Downloads
**Definition:** The number of times a design is downloaded.<br>
**Purpose:** Downloads provide insights into the popularity and demand for a design. A high number of downloads typically signifies that users find the design valuable enough to use it offline or in other applications.

##### 3. Deployments
**Definition:** The number of times a design is deployed.<br>
**Purpose:** This metric shows how often a design is implemented or put into action. High deployment numbers can indicate the practical applicability and effectiveness of a design in real-world scenarios.

##### 4. Clones
**Definition:** The number of times a design is cloned or duplicated.<br>
**Purpose:** Cloning metrics indicate how often users are creating copies of a design for modification or personal use. It reflects the adaptability and flexibility of the design to meet various user needs.

##### 5. Shares
**Definition:** The number of times a design is shared with others.<br>
**Purpose:** Shares measure the social aspect of design usage. A high number of shares suggests that users find the design valuable and worth recommending to others, indicating community engagement and word-of-mouth promotion.
