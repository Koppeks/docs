### User Accounts

Every person who uses Layer5 Cloud signs into a user account. Your user account is your identity on Layer5 Cloud and has a username and profile. For example, see Five's profile.

{{< alert type="warning" title="TODO" >}}Insert Five's user profile here.{{< /alert >}}

Your user account can own resources such as workspaces, designs, connections, credentials, tokens, Any time you take any action on Layer5 Cloud such as creating a design or reviewing a deployment request, the action is attributed to your user account.

Each user account is subscribed to a plan: Free, Team, or Enterprise. All user accounts can own an unlimited number of public and private workspaces, with an unlimited number of collaborators on those workspaces. If you use Layer5 Free, private workspaces owned by your user account have a limited feature set. You can upgrade to Layer5 Enterprise to get a full feature set for private workspaces. For more information, see [Layer5 subscription plans](https://layer5.io/pricing).

Teams allow you to organize users into groups and conveniently assign access to workspaces or to assign roles with associated keychains and keys to control permissions. For more information, see [Teams](/cloud/identity/teams).

Organizations are the basic unit of multi-tenancy inside of Layer5 Cloud.

Organizations may have any number of teams and teams may have any number of users. User accounts are treated as sovereign entities that are owned by individual individuals, not by corporations.
