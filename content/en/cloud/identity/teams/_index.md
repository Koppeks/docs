Organizations are the basic unit of multi-tenancy inside of Layer5 Cloud. Organizations can have any number of teams. Teams can have any number of users. Users can belong to any number of teams. Users may belong to any number of organizations.

Outside of grouping users together, teams offer control access to workspaces and to workspace resources such as environments and managed and unmanaged connections.

## Add a Team

To apply different settings to a set of users, create a new team within your organization. You can then apply unique settings to that team, such as access to specific workspaces and their associated environments.

A team is a group created by an administrator to apply common settings and access controls to a specific set of users within an organization. By default, all users are part of the top-level organization. Teams inherit settings from the parent organization, but these can be customized as needed for the team.

Currently, hierarchical teams are not supported; all teams exist at the same level directly under the organization. Changes to settings at the organization level will propagate to all teams that inherit those settings, while custom team settings will remain unchanged.

If you are the current team owner, you canâ€™t remove yourself from the team until you transfer ownership to another team administrator.

## Open Team Invite

The "Open Team Invite" feature allows administrators to enable a specific invitation method for users to join a particular team. This is intended to function like an [Open Org Invite Link](https://docs.layer5.io/cloud/identity/users/user-management/), but for a specific team, providing a direct way to invite members rather than adding them manually.

### Why Use Open Team Invite

* **Targeted Team Invites:** Directly invite users to join specific teams.
* **Streamlined Access:** Simplify onboarding for users needing access to particular project groups or shared resources within a team.
* **Focused Membership:** Works in conjunction with organization invites, allowing users to first join the organization and then be guided into specific teams.

{{< alert type="info" title="For Organization-Specific Invitations">}}
If your goal is to invite users only to a specific organization (and not directly to a team as part of the same invitation), please refer to the documentation on [Open Org Invite Link and User Management](https://docs.layer5.io/cloud/identity/users/user-management/).

### How Open Team Invite Works

1.  **Copy Team Invite Link:** After clicking the relevant UI element, the link is copied to your clipboard.[^1]
2.  **Share Link:** Distribute this copied "Team Invite Link" to the individuals you intend to invite to the team.
3.  **User Onboarding with Team Invite Link:** When a user clicks the "Team Invite Link," the system handles their onboarding as follows:
    * **If the user has no system account:** They are guided through the account registration process. Upon successful registration, they are automatically added to **both** the relevant organization and the specific team.
    * **If the user has a system account but is not in the target organization:** Upon using the link, they are added to **both** the organization and the specific team.
    * **If the user is already in the organization (and has an account):** Upon using the link, they are added to the specific team.
4.  **Manual Alternative:** As an alternative, administrators can always manually add existing organization members to a team.
