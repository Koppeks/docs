You can change the logo, color scheme, domain name, and other aspects of the user interface to match your own identity and preferences. White-labeling enables you to offer a seamless and consistent experience to your customers, partners, or internal users who access your service mesh platform. White-labeling also helps you to differentiate your platform from other Layer5 Cloud users and competitors, and to enhance your brand recognition and loyalty.

## Customizing Themes

The Layer5 Cloud dashboard can be customized with your own branding, including your full-sized logo, logo mark, and color scheme.

Visit the Layer5 Cloud dashboard and navigate to the settings page to customize the theme.

## Customizing Logos

Layer5 Cloud supports customizing themes on a per organization basis. This includes the ability to upload your own logo and define your own color scheme. Your logo will be displayed in the top left corner of the dashboard. Both a full-sized logo and a logo mark are supported.

## Customizing Domain Name

Layer5 Cloud supports customizing the login screen based on custom domain name. Redirect your users to your own domain name. For example, if your domain name is `mycompany.com`, you can redirect users to `meshery.mycompany.com`.

Example: https://meshery.layer5.io/signup?program=cncf
